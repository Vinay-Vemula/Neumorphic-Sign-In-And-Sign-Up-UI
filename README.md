## Neumorphic Signin and Signup

        Neumorphism is a design technique that is based around soft UI elements. Think of a frost effect or a glassy blur. Elements appear to extrude from the background, which makes them stand out. But since they tend to use a soft UI color palette, the effect is usually more subtle than bold.
